exactly as advertised. This review unit arrived with excellent timing. The day after I installed it the power here went out for over an hour with several outages the following week!

Not only did the BU 600 keep my cable modem, gigabit switch and a high end router running without missing a beat, I was even able to keep my phone charging. Estimated run time with the new battery and minimalist load was 3 hours+. Of course age reduces the battery capacity, but if you use this product in your server room, it will keep your web connections and routers running like nothing happened for at least 60+ minutes

Management software is a free download. The unit was detected on my win7/64 laptop USB and windows drivers installed, and then I installed the APC software. No eyebrow raisers there.

Wall mounting holes a nice touch. USB charge port @ 1.5amps shows engineers are listening to customers. I&#x27;m seeing this all over the business lately. I just bought a nice desk lamp that has a USB charge port on it.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> <!-- -->PowerChute software has been around long enough that I would expect all little issues to be resolved. My software reported that I was drawing just 3-6 watts of power while running on battery.  My phone drawing 5volts at 1 amp is 5 watts on its own.

That seemed pretty low, but bottom line with a small load of mission critical network gear you should expect the Back UPS 600 to keep you connected fsor most short outages. Out average outage here is under 30 minutes. The unit was tested a few times during the second week it was here, as the power went out several times a day.

No software on CD must be downloaded from APC ( not a con for me, I have multiple APC units on site so the software was sitting on a NAS)

While my unit was perfect, you&#x27;ll notice several duds and complaints. Don&#x27;t expect high quality control standards on a product selling sub $100 these days. Failure numbers as high as 5% might be acceptable.</p><p><strong>Overall Review:</strong> <!-- -->CHARGE the battery for 24 hours before use. I can&#x27;t emphasize this enough. Good battery management calls for it. 

Without doubt the life of an SLA battery is maximized by not discharging it for long periods when it didn&#x27;t start out fully charged. Battery should be inexpensive to replace in a few years. 

Typically USP batteries start declines after about two years, unless your electrical grid looks like something out of New Delhi in which case the life will be shorter if you have to hit it often. The self test will watch battery performance an ping you when the battery is due for a replacement.

Most of my APC gear has held up over the years, I wore out a couple of them, but considering that a $300 bit can protect thousands worth of gear, I just replace my mission critical ones every few years. The batteries on the larger units are expensive.

A five egg rating as the entire experience as was exactly what was expected from a consumers standpoint.

My expectations as a seasoned tech was also met without any broken eggs.</p></div><div class="comments-helpful has-button"><span class="comments-text">15 out of 15 people found this review helpful.<span> Did you?</span></span><button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">Yes</button>Â <button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">No</button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="comments-cell has-side-left is-active"><div class="comments-cell-side"><div class="comments-name"><a href="https://www.newegg.com/d/profile/reviews/azRIY1c3cFhrQnVoQzNodTVkQTB3QT09" title="View Milton B.&#x27;s Profile" target="_blank" data-t-events="A" data-t-e-var78="$ - Profile:azRIY1c3cFhrQnVoQzNodTVkQTB3QT09">Milton B.</a></div><div class="comments-text comments-eggxpert"><a href="#" class="open-popup"><img alt="" src="https://c1.neweggimages.com/WebResource/Themes/2005/Nest/none.gif"/> <!-- -->Eggxpert Review</a></div></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-title"><i class="rating rating-4"></i><span class="comments-title-content">Great for many uses. 2 Year warranty.</span><span class="comments-text">9/25/2016 6:14:56 PM</span></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-content"><p><strong>Pros:</strong> <!-- -->For the average Home PC, Laptop and several other ways of using this for Surge Protection and Battery Backup. Included USB connection, and software putting you in charge of how soon to turn off plugged in PCâs, Laptops.

A total of 7 AC plug connections. 5 with Battery Backup, 2 surge protection only. The AC Sockets are wider spaced. This can be used for more than just computers, you can use this for Routers, Switches and other plugged in items around your desk/work area.  This has a 5ft angled ac plug cord. The AC plugs are wider spaced allowing for more opportunity for all your plugs to fit. 

Handy USB Charging Port for Cellphone, Tablet Etc..</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> <!-- -->None.</p><p><strong>Overall Review:</strong> <!-- -->When shopping for Uninterruptible Power Supply, itâs not always necessary to over buy, in terms of available backup power. 600VA wonât handle a hi-end Gaming PC, but it will do great UPS protection and power for most average home PCâs, Laptops, Routers, Switches, Backup Drivesâ¦ even a lamp.

I first followed the directions and plugged in the battery. I like that itâs shipped, fresh battery on the ready and unused. Just open the door on the bottom, plug in the battery terminals and youâre ready. I let mine charge overnight and started with my Laptop and Router. When I pulled the AC plug and saw how far I could still stay connected, the Power Chute Software showed way more than needed time to stay connected. Over a half hour of run time was how long I had. Schedule how soon the Power Chute Software should safely turn off your PC. 

I guess I was the lucky one. No beeps, no miss signaling annoying me. This is doing its job, and within its specs is a good value for the price. You could easily spend twice as much and not need the extra battery life. I have other APC Battery Backupâs being used and is my go to brand. MY setup has several, several electrical devices from my printer to my LAN switch, to my router and so on. The APC can also support these along with your PC, Laptop, etc.

I didnât write a review an hour after getting it, I have tried it out over weeks. I can think of 3 people that could use this rated Battery backup and be covered for their needs, and have a $75,000-dollar equipment protection guarantee. Having protection from electrical surges, lightening is where you want the blow out, not your PC and equipment. For a good value APC and a 2 year warranty, this is a nice Battery Backup.</p></div><div class="comments-helpful has-button"><span class="comments-text">6 out of 6 people found this review helpful.<span> Did you?</span></span><button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">Yes</button>Â <button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">No</button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="comments-cell has-side-left is-active"><div class="comments-cell-side"><div class="comments-name"><a href="https://www.newegg.com/d/profile/reviews/dGNFMVVIL0J6b1MyMEI2V2NvM21Ycktic04xVGxoVjE%3D" title="View Brian D.&#x27;s Profile" target="_blank" data-t-events="A" data-t-e-var78="$ - Profile:dGNFMVVIL0J6b1MyMEI2V2NvM21Ycktic04xVGxoVjE=">Brian D.</a></div><div class="comments-text comments-eggxpert"><a href="#" class="open-popup"><img alt="" src="https://c1.neweggimages.com/WebResource/Themes/2005/Nest/none.gif"/> <!-- -->Eggxpert Review</a></div></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-title"><i class="rating rating-5"></i><span class="comments-title-content">My new go-to for home/office setups</span><span class="comments-text">9/18/2018 12:27:12 PM</span></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-content"><p><strong>Pros:</strong> <!-- -->Extremely light and small for the backup/power rating it has. Price is also very good for this unit. Performance was great and no issues with power delivery with any of the outlets or the USB port. Great quality and to be expected from APC.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> <!-- -->Functionally, nothing. My only issue with it is that I prefer to have my plugs in the back of a vertical APC backup unit. With the plugs on this being on the top, it can create an issue of being able to properly hide connecting device cables. This is just a preference thing, for the price and form factor of this unit it is still a killer device.</p><p><strong>Overall Review:</strong> <!-- -->I found my new go-to backup device for workstations. For the price/performance/features/form-factor, it is perfect for under a desk. The traditional model that I have used in the past is the flat model with vertical plugs, but it is heavy and takes up much more space under a desk. This not only has a smaller footprint, but also has a built-in USB port which is very nice. 

Overall, this is a great product for what it claims to be. It does not have a LCD screen with live updates, but it is not priced for that either. It does not have 10 backup ports, but itâs not priced for that either. It has an average output for a desktop setup, has monitoring options via a USB cable, and a small form factor for space saving on/under a desk. And it does all that for a competitive price and maintains APC quality, a win-win in my book. I would highly recommend this to someone who needs a solid battery backup for their desktop machine at home or their work machine at the office.</p></div><div class="comments-helpful has-button"><span class="comments-text">5 out of 5 people found this review helpful.<span> Did you?</span></span><button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">Yes</button>Â <button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">No</button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="comments-cell has-side-left is-active"><div class="comments-cell-side"><div class="comments-name">Anonymous</div><div class="comments-text comments-eggxpert"><a href="#" class="open-popup"><img alt="" src="https://c1.neweggimages.com/WebResource/Themes/2005/Nest/none.gif"/> <!-- -->Eggxpert Review</a></div></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-title"><i class="rating rating-5"></i><span class="comments-title-content">Great low profile UPS</span><span class="comments-text">2/12/2017 10:06:08 AM</span></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-content"><p><strong>Pros:</strong> <!-- -->- small size makes it easier to run it in the home office and keeps the wife happy

The router means I can still use my home wifi and not my cellular data which is nice too.

I tested this by throwing the breaker and seeing how long it&#x27;d run. I originally tried to keep my server on the UPS but it drained the battery too fast. 

This device is perfect for my usage, it allows me sufficient time to get my generator up and running without losing Internet or NAS connectivity.</p></div><div class="comments-helpful has-button"><span class="comments-text">4 out of 4 people found this review helpful.<span> Did you?</span></span><button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">Yes</button>Â <button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">No</button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="comments-cell has-side-left is-active"><div class="comments-cell-side"><div class="comments-name"><a href="https://www.newegg.com/d/profile/reviews/K2xOWWMwVTZRMWErYW5pd3NnZk5jQT09" title="View Joshua M.&#x27;s Profile" target="_blank" data-t-events="A" data-t-e-var78="$ - Profile:K2xOWWMwVTZRMWErYW5pd3NnZk5jQT09">Joshua M.</a></div><div class="comments-text comments-eggxpert"><a href="#" class="open-popup"><img alt="" src="https://c1.neweggimages.com/WebResource/Themes/2005/Nest/none.gif"/> <!-- -->Eggxpert Review</a></div></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-title"><i class="rating rating-5"></i><span class="comments-title-content">Great UPS for HTPC or other low power equipment</span><span class="comments-text">2/9/2017 6:16:11 AM</span></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-content"><p><strong>Pros:</strong> <!-- -->Great build quality.

â¢ 5 Battery backup outlets
â¢ All outlets protected with surge suppression.
â¢ USB charging port (1.5A)
â¢ PC power monitoring software (PowerChute)
â¢ LED power mode indicator (AC, battery backup)
â¢ Muted aesthetics, not an eye catcher.
â¢ 45Âº angled power plug is great for crowded outlets or power strips.
â¢ Seamless backup power in the event of power loss. 

I set this battery backup for use with my PC and monitor, and has been a great addition to my set up. The PowerChute software provides almost real-time power consumption and estimated battery run time on power failure. The PowerChute software can be configured to shut down your PC for you in the event of power loss, at a set interval of time. 
For my hardware scenario I set the software to 5 minutes on battery before shutting down my PC, given my current PC hardware configuration. 
Current specs:
i7 5820k
x99 motherboard
GTX 1060 6GB OC
16GB DDR4 1.35v (2x 8GB)
2 SSDâs, and one 3TB WD black HD.
1x BD/DVD optical.
4 140mm fans, 2 120mm fans
630W 80+ gold rated PSU

This battery backup is sufficient for my use, as even under load (gaming) the software reports that I should have more than 6 minutes of battery run time. At idle the PowerChute software reports that I should have 18+ minutes on battery, which is plenty of time to save work and shut down should I choose to extend the battery run time before auto shutdown.

Some other nice features of the PowerChute software is that it can report daily cost of operating attached equipment, total energy usage per month in kWh and interestingly estimated carbon dioxide emissions per day. Perform firmware updates, run self diagnostics, set hours at which alarms are active (if you dont want to be alerted to an alarm at 3 a.m.)
What Iâve checked most often is the current energy consumption and load on battery backup. I was surprised to see that my system uses much less energy than I thought, with an average of 115 Watts at idle, and 265 +/- Watts under load, this is including my 144Hz monitor drawing 23 Watts.

I really like the addition of a USB charging port, which also provides power on battery. 
This is a great way to charge your phone in a power outage, a 1.5 amp capacity should be enough for most phones and most tablets.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> <!-- -->-
The UPS I received had a strong chemical odor, which dissipated after about a week.
(I may have been unlucky with the unit I received, but if you are sensitive to chemical smells, you might consider unpacking and leaving this unit in a room that you don&#x27;t frequent, for a few days)

The PowerChute software is available as a download from APC, the easiest way to find it is to follow the address from the included instructions. If you try to navigate to the software from apc.com it can be confusing if youâre not sure what youâre looking for, as most of their products are geared toward commercial applications.</p><p><strong>Overall Review:</strong> <!-- -->~
The capacity of this backup should be a good match for most PC users needs, but of course not everyone has the same power needs. I would likely choose a higher capacity backup for more demanding systems. My current configuration has about 6 minutes run time under load, which is a thin margin, for a 5 minute auto shutdown on battery power. However; in the event of power loss, I should have plenty of warning.

Although I configured this backup for use with my PC, there are many different scenarios that you could use this backup.  

Using this as a dedicated battery backup for a modem and router, could provide internet access during an outage (if there is no damage to the lines or external events that would prevent access). Even attaching Wi-Fi enabled power outlet(s) aside from the modem and router could provide power to emergency lighting controllable from your smart phone or tablet.
You could even attach a USB powered light to the charging port for emergency battery backup lighting.

I wish this back up was considered portable, but lead-acid batteries can be a bit dangerous, so I wouldnât pack one in your hiking backpack. Charging it up and carrying it to the back deck to power a radio should be fine (just make sure its not going to rain).

Overall this has been a fantastic backup through out my testing. The PowerChute software was more informative and useful than I expected, and the USB charging port was also a welcome addition. 
The pros far outweigh the cons, and would be an easy recommendation to anyone looking for a decent battery backup with this capacity. 5 eggs.</p></div><div class="comments-helpful has-button"><span class="comments-text">17 out of 20 people found this review helpful.<span> Did you?</span></span><button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">Yes</button>Â <button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">No</button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="comments-cell has-side-left is-active"><div class="comments-cell-side"><div class="comments-name"><a href="https://www.newegg.com/d/profile/reviews/UENtNit2eldaWXhWOEZSVzFYc3czdz09" title="View Joshua M.&#x27;s Profile" target="_blank" data-t-events="A" data-t-e-var78="$ - Profile:UENtNit2eldaWXhWOEZSVzFYc3czdz09">Joshua M.</a></div><div class="comments-text comments-eggxpert"><a href="#" class="open-popup"><img alt="" src="https://c1.neweggimages.com/WebResource/Themes/2005/Nest/none.gif"/> <!-- -->Eggxpert Review</a></div></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-title"><i class="rating rating-5"></i><span class="comments-title-content">Simple, Inexpensive UPS</span><span class="comments-text">10/20/2018 10:09:20 PM</span></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-content"><p><strong>Pros:</strong> <!-- -->This is a fairly simple, inexpensive battery backup. It appears to built well, the battery is easily accessible for replacement. The power button is recessed a bit which is a nice touch so you don&#x27;t accidentally turn it off and the green power light is not too bright or annoying. The unit includes a USB charging port that could be used to charge a phone or other USB device during a power outage. The unit can be cold started (turned out without being plugged in), which is something I always like to see a UPS able to do. The Powerchute software that works with the unit is fairly simple and easy to configure, as well as it lets you monitor the status of the UPS. This UPS can provide enough power for a regular desktop to have time to save work and shut down properly, or keep a cable modem and wireless router on for a few hours.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> <!-- -->The unit could use a small display with some status information like those found on the large units. Also an extra USB port would be nice as well.  The battery charge time is a bit long if you happen to suffer multiple outages in a day. The Powerchute software could also use a little less of the extra fluff. Beyond that the unit is working well and I can&#x27;t complain for the price point.</p><p><strong>Overall Review:</strong> <!-- -->I tested this unit for a month, and during that time I actually suffered a power outage and was able to use it in my living room to keep a lamp on for a few hours as well as get onto my laptop for about 15 minutes to report the power outage. My other testing included running a modern performance desktop off of it under light load, it was able to run the PC and the 28&quot; LED backlit monitor for 12 minutes and 29 seconds. Had I installed the Powerchute it would have shut down after 7 minutes since I would have configured it to keep the machine on as long as possible ( it issues a shutdown when there is less than 5 minutes of battery power left on the longest running setting ). I monitored the unit after I ran the battery to what it reported as 0% and it took almost 10 hours to recharge to 100% again, kind of slow but not troublesome. Overall I am happy with the unit for what it is and what it costs, I plan to keep it on my cable modem and router for future power outages.</p></div><div class="comments-helpful has-button"><span class="comments-text">8 out of 9 people found this review helpful.<span> Did you?</span></span><button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">Yes</button>Â <button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">No</button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="comments-cell has-side-left is-active"><div class="comments-cell-side"><div class="comments-name"><a href="https://www.newegg.com/d/profile/reviews/WjNkYjAxVjhmNVBNZEFZOENzQlJUZz09" title="View Phil M.&#x27;s Profile" target="_blank" data-t-events="A" data-t-e-var78="$ - Profile:WjNkYjAxVjhmNVBNZEFZOENzQlJUZz09">Phil M.</a></div><div class="comments-text comments-eggxpert"><a href="#" class="open-popup"><img alt="" src="https://c1.neweggimages.com/WebResource/Themes/2005/Nest/none.gif"/> <!-- -->Eggxpert Review</a></div></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-title"><i class="rating rating-5"></i><span class="comments-title-content">BE670M1 â I like it</span><span class="comments-text">9/13/2018 12:58:28 PM</span></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-content"><p><strong>Pros:</strong> <!-- -->- It really is small for the VA rating.  I have two other 600VA UPS units and they are 2x-3x the size volume wise.  It is also fairly thin.  It would have been great to fit into a phone interface cabinet I worked on several years ago.  It had a PBX, cable modem and WiFi router in it.  We had to build a shelf on the wall outside of it for the UPS.  Ugly and a little precarious.  This would have fit.  Perhaps another good application would be an external DVR enclosure for a camera system.  Hopefully you get the idea.

- The keyholes for mounting on the back side look like they could be useful.  I donât have use for them at the moment, but 
The price of the APC 650 VA (with the older style case) is about $11 more expensive than this 675 VA unit.  That makes this unit a better value in terms of $/VA.  A quick search and you will find it competitive with other manufacturers as well.

- The PowerChute software works for what it is intended, and the interface is the cleanest I have seen so far.  The functionality of PowerChute is a bit more limited than I have seen in other products, but does what you need it to do.  That is, give you an idea of how heavily you are loaded, how much time you could go without power and shut down your computer gracefully at a configurable low battery threshold (which I would recommend raising from default).  I raised mine way up to test shutdown and it worked as advertised.  I will tell you this: If your threshold is set low, in a year or more when your battery is aging, it will fail before the threshold or shortly after and not give your computer enough time to shut down.  I have seen this more times than I have seen this feature work!  I would say 30%-50% is a good threshhold.

- USB charging port?  Iâm using it right now to charge my vape while I write this review.  Not really sure when your UPS is sitting next to you and other USB ports are not, but OK.  It does work.

- When I tested by pulling the plug from the wall, the unit eventually ran out of battery.  When I plugged it back in, the unit did not require manual intervention to restore power to its ports.  Some of my UPSs require me to press and hold the power button for a couple seconds to restore normal operation.  Meanwhile everything is dead.  This may not sound like a big deal, but it is to me and I am happy this APC unit works that way.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> <!-- -->- There are only five battery outlets and two surge-only outlets.  I think this is probably enough for 675 VA.  The spacing is good for a combination of wall warts and straight plugs (see pictures).

- There is no display of voltage or current draw as seen in higher tier APC products and maybe even a few competitors at this price point.  I really like that information displayed at a glance.  You can see Wattage (divide by Voltage to get Amperage) through PowerChute, but itâs not as easy.  Not that big a deal.  I have bigger UPSs with the display and I can count on one hand how many times I looked at them.  Their brightness has probably irritated me more than the utility of it.  Yet on the other hand again, I have on numerous occasions moved a UPS with a display around to test the current draw of something or other.  A display on this unit would be especially useful due to its small form factor and ease of moving around.  I am being wishy washy, I know.  Itâs a trade-off.  And yes a clamp-on ammeter is on wish list.

- The battery compartment.  Its on the bottom.  The door is pretty solid.  I donât think it will break like others I have.  Here is my beef, and I have yet to see a UPS from any manufacturer that fail here:  The cable management in the battery compartment is ridiculous, and I am not talking about aesthetics.  The batteryâs leads donât run and connect in a sensible way.  It is always a puzzle to get them hooked onto the battery, battery pushed in so that no leads slip free during battery insertion, no wires are pinched or stretched and the bay door closes.  APC has smartly disconnected the positive lead for shipping, so with this unit I got to experience my pet peeve first thing.</p><p><strong>Overall Review:</strong> <!-- -->- RBC battery 4.15âx 5.95â x 2.55â $40 on APC vs $20 elsewhere.  12v ~7ah.  I have never seen this battery before.  A quick search found it is not too rare, however, the model number on the battery is only RPC.  When carefully measuring it and examining the specs on APC website I got one set of dimensions.  I found âRPCâ elsewhere with dimensions different enough so that I know those replacements wouldnât fit.  Be careful, I guess, but UPS batteries WILL fail within a couple of years and when they do, it takes a small feat of engineering to get a replacement from another source.  Am I a miser?  Should I just go to APCs website and pay double?  I probably spend $100/year on replacement batteries.  It adds up, but I am never really sure they work as well.  

- I have used UPS units for thirty years.  My expectations have changed since the first one I bought.  I live in Central Florida on the East coast.  It may be due to the excessive amounts of lightning we get, but especially in the summer we lose power once a week or so.  It usually lasts less than 60 seconds, but sometimes maybe a couple or three minutes.  Computers, DVRs, routers, gigabit switches and the fiber modem all hum along without incident.  No waiting for crashed computers to boot up (if they ever do), no troubleshooting router issues or Heaven forbid part of the show a DVR was recording didnât record.  This is where a UPS shines.

- When Irma was blowing through and the power went out, I shut everything down and we used them to charge the cell phones and cell phone external batteries.  You could keep your cell phones charged for a few days with this unit.

- The point is, they are not magic power.  They work great for really short outages.  Anything more than about ten minutes and you should be thinking about something more industrial with car batteries and a generator.</p></div><div class="comments-helpful has-button"><span class="comments-text">5 out of 7 people found this review helpful.<span> Did you?</span></span><button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">Yes</button>Â <button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">No</button></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Product","aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingValue":4,"reviewCount":404},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","availability":"http://schema.org/InStock","price":"54.99","priceCurrency":"USD","url":"https://www.newegg.com/apc-be670m1-2-x-nema-5-15r-5-x-nema-5-15r/p/N82E16842301701"},"description":"APC BE670M1 675 VA 360 Watts 7 Outlets Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) with USB Charging Port (Stepup of BE600M1)","name":"APC BE670M1 675 VA 360 Watts 7 Outlets Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) with USB Charging Port (Stepup of BE600M1)","sku":"N82E16842301701","brand":"APC","mpn":"BE670M1","gtin12":"731304341925","Model":"BE670M1","image":"https://c1.neweggimages.com/ProductImage/42-301-701-V01.jpg","review":[{"@type":"Review","author":"Peter P.","datePublished":"2016-10-02","description":"Pros: Operated exactly as advertised. This review unit arrived with excellent timing. The day after I installed it the power here went out for over an hour with several outages the following week!\n\nNot only did the BU 600 keep my cable modem, gigabit switch and a high end router running without missing a beat, I was even able to keep my phone charging. Estimated run time with the new battery and minimalist load was 3 hours+. Of course age reduces the battery capacity, but if you use this product in your server room, it will keep your web connections and routers running like nothing happened for at least 60+ minutes\n\nManagement software is a free download. The unit was detected on my win7/64 laptop USB and windows drivers installed, and then I installed the APC software. No eyebrow raisers there.\n\nWall mounting holes a nice touch. USB charge port @ 1.5amps shows engineers are listening to customers. I'm seeing this all over the business lately. I just bought a nice desk lamp that has a USB charge port on it. Cons: PowerChute software has been around long enough that I would expect all little issues to be resolved. My software reported that I was drawing just 3-6 watts of power while running on battery.  My phone drawing 5volts at 1 amp is 5 watts on its own.\n\nThat seemed pretty low, but bottom line with a small load of mission critical network gear you should expect the Back UPS 600 to keep you connected fsor most short outages. Out average outage here is under 30 minutes. The unit was tested a few times during the second week it was here, as the power went out several times a day.\n\nNo software on CD must be downloaded from APC ( not a con for me, I have multiple APC units on site so the software was sitting on a NAS)\n\nWhile my unit was perfect, you'll notice several duds and complaints. Don't expect high quality control standards on a product selling sub $100 these days. Failure numbers as high as 5% might be acceptable. Overall Review: CHARGE the battery for 24 hours before use. I can't emphasize this enough. Good battery management calls for it. \n\nWithout doubt the life of an SLA battery is maximized by not discharging it for long periods when it didn't start out fully charged. Battery should be inexpensive to replace in a few years. \n\nTypically USP batteries start declines after about two years, unless your electrical grid looks like something out of New Delhi in which case the life will be shorter if you have to hit it often. The self test will watch battery performance an ping you when the battery is due for a replacement.\n\nMost of my APC gear has held up over the years, I wore out a couple of them, but considering that a $300 bit can protect thousands worth of gear, I just replace my mission critical ones every few years. The batteries on the larger units are expensive.\n\nA five egg rating as the entire experience as was exactly what was expected from a consumers standpoint.\n\nMy expectations as a seasoned tech was also met without any broken eggs.","name":"Fit my application perfectly with eggcellent fucntionality","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":"5","ratingValue":"5","worstRating":"1"}},{"@type":"Review","author":"Milton B.","datePublished":"2016-09-25","description":"Pros: For the average Home PC, Laptop and several other ways of using this for Surge Protection and Battery Backup.

Price is also very good for this unit. Performance was great and no issues with power delivery with any of the outlets or the USB port. Great quality and to be expected from APC. Cons: Functionally, nothing. My only issue with it is that I prefer to have my plugs in the back of a vertical APC backup unit. With the plugs on this being on the top, it can create an issue of being able to properly hide connecting device cables. This is just a preference thing, for the price and form factor of this unit it is still a killer device. Overall Review: I found my new go-to backup device for workstations. For the price/performance/features/form-factor, it is perfect for under a desk. The traditional model that I have used in the past is the flat model with vertical plugs, but it is heavy and takes up much more space under a desk. This not only has a smaller footprint, but also has a built-in USB port which is very nice. \n\nOverall, this is a great product for what it claims to be. It does not have a LCD screen with live updates, but it is not priced for that either. It does not have 10 backup ports, but itâs not priced for that either. It has an average output for a desktop setup, has monitoring options via a USB cable, and a small form factor for space saving on/under a desk.

The PowerChute software can be configured to shut down your PC for you in the event of power loss, at a set interval of time. \nFor my hardware scenario I set the software to 5 minutes on battery before shutting down my PC, given my current PC hardware configuration. \nCurrent specs:\ni7 5820k\nx99 motherboard\nGTX 1060 6GB OC\n16GB DDR4 1.35v (2x 8GB)\n2 SSDâs, and one 3TB WD black HD.\n1x BD/DVD optical.\n4 140mm fans, 2 120mm fans\n630W 80+ gold rated PSU\n\nThis battery backup is sufficient for my use, as even under load (gaming) the software reports that I should have more than 6 minutes of battery run time. At idle the PowerChute software reports that I should have 18+ minutes on battery, which is plenty of time to save work and shut down should I choose to extend the battery run time before auto shutdown.\n\nSome other nice features of the PowerChute software is that it can report daily cost of operating attached equipment, total energy usage per month in kWh and interestingly estimated carbon dioxide emissions per day. Perform firmware updates, run self diagnostics, set hours at which alarms are active (if you dont want to be alerted to an alarm at 3 a.m.)\nWhat Iâve checked most often is the current energy consumption and load on battery backup. I was surprised to see that my system uses much less energy than I thought, with an average of 115 Watts at idle, and 265 +/- Watts under load, this is including my 144Hz monitor drawing 23 Watts.\n\nI really like the addition of a USB charging port, which also provides power on battery. \nThis is a great way to charge your phone in a power outage, a 1.5 amp capacity should be enough for most phones and most tablets. Cons: -\nThe UPS I received had a strong chemical odor, which dissipated after about a week.\n(I may have been unlucky with the unit I received, but if you are sensitive to chemical smells, you might consider unpacking and leaving this unit in a room that you don't frequent, for a few days)\n\nThe PowerChute software is available as a download from APC, the easiest way to find it is to follow the address from the included instructions. If you try to navigate to the software from apc.com it can be confusing if youâre not sure what youâre looking for, as most of their products are geared toward commercial applications. Overall Review: ~\nThe capacity of this backup should be a good match for most PC users needs, but of course not everyone has the same power needs. I would likely choose a higher capacity backup for more demanding systems. My current configuration has about 6 minutes run time under load, which is a thin margin, for a 5 minute auto shutdown on battery power. However; in the event of power loss, I should have plenty of warning.\n\nAlthough I configured this backup for use with my PC, there are many different scenarios that you could use this backup.  \n\nUsing this as a dedicated battery backup for a modem and router, could provide internet access during an outage (if there is no damage to the lines or external events that would prevent access). Even attaching Wi-Fi enabled power outlet(s) aside from the modem and router could provide power to emergency lighting controllable from your smart phone or tablet.\nYou could even attach a USB powered light to the charging port for emergency battery backup lighting.\n\nI wish this back up was considered portable, but lead-acid batteries can be a bit dangerous, so I wouldnât pack one in your hiking backpack. Charging it up and carrying it to the back deck to power a radio should be fine (just make sure its not going to rain).\n\nOverall this has been a fantastic backup through out my testing. The PowerChute software was more informative and useful than I expected, and the USB charging port was also a welcome addition. \nThe pros far outweigh the cons, and would be an easy recommendation to anyone looking for a decent battery backup with this capacity. 5 eggs.","name":"APC BE600M1","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":"5","ratingValue":"5","worstRating":"1"}},{"@type":"Review","author":"Joshua M.","datePublished":"2018-10-20","description":"Pros: This is a fairly simple, inexpensive battery backup. It appears to built well, the battery is easily accessible for replacement. The power button is recessed a bit which is a nice touch so you don't accidentally turn it off and the green power light is not too bright or annoying. The unit includes a USB charging port that could be used to charge a phone or other USB device during a power outage. The unit can be cold started (turned out without being plugged in), which is something I always like to see a UPS able to do. The Powerchute software that works with the unit is fairly simple and easy to configure, as well as it lets you monitor the status of the UPS. This UPS can provide enough power for a regular desktop to have time to save work and shut down properly, or keep a cable modem and wireless router on for a few hours. Cons: The unit could use a small display with some status information like those found on the large units. Also an extra USB port would be nice as well.  The battery charge time is a bit long if you happen to suffer multiple outages in a day. The Powerchute software could also use a little less of the extra fluff. Beyond that the unit is working well and I can't complain for the price point. Overall Review: I tested this unit for a month, and during that time I actually suffered a power outage and was able to use it in my living room to keep a lamp on for a few hours as well as get onto my laptop for about 15 minutes to report the power outage. My other testing included running a modern performance desktop off of it under light load, it was able to run the PC and the 28\" LED backlit monitor for 12 minutes and 29 seconds. Had I installed the Powerchute it would have shut down after 7 minutes since I would have configured it to keep the machine on as long as possible ( it issues a shutdown when there is less than 5 minutes of battery power left on the longest running setting ). I monitored the unit after I ran the battery to what it reported as 0% and it took almost 10 hours to recharge to 100% again, kind of slow but not troublesome. Overall I am happy with the unit for what it is and what it costs, I plan to keep it on my cable modem and router for future power outages.","name":"Simple, Inexpensive UPS","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":"5","ratingValue":"5","worstRating":"1"}},{"@type":"Review","author":"Phil M.","datePublished":"2018-09-13","description":"Pros: - It really is small for the VA rating.  I have two other 600VA UPS units and they are 2x-3x the size volume wise.  It is also fairly thin.  It would have been great to fit into a phone interface cabinet I worked on several years ago.  It had a PBX, cable modem and WiFi router in it.  We had to build a shelf on the wall outside of it for the UPS.  Ugly and a little precarious.  This would have fit.  Perhaps another good application would be an external DVR enclosure for a camera system.  Hopefully you get the idea.\n\n- The keyholes for mounting on the back side look like they could be useful.  I donât have use for them at the moment, but \nThe price of the APC 650 VA (with the older style case) is about $11 more expensive than this 675 VA unit.  That makes this unit a better value in terms of $/VA.  A quick search and you will find it competitive with other manufacturers as well.\n\n- The PowerChute software works for what it is intended, and the interface is the cleanest I have seen so far.  The functionality of PowerChute is a bit more limited than I have seen in other products, but does what you need it to do.  That is, give you an idea of how heavily you are loaded, how much time you could go without power and shut down your computer gracefully at a configurable low battery threshold (which I would recommend raising from default).  I raised mine way up to test shutdown and it worked as advertised.  I will tell you this: If your threshold is set low, in a year or more when your battery is aging, it will fail before the threshold or shortly after and not give your computer enough time to shut down.  I have seen this more times than I have seen this feature work!  I would say 30%-50% is a good threshhold.\n\n- USB charging port?  Iâm using it right now to charge my vape while I write this review.  Not really sure when your UPS is sitting next to you and other USB ports are not, but OK.  It does work.\n\n- When I tested by pulling the plug from the wall, the unit eventually ran out of battery.  When I plugged it back in, the unit did not require manual intervention to restore power to its ports.  Some of my UPSs require me to press and hold the power button for a couple seconds to restore normal operation.  Meanwhile everything is dead.  This may not sound like a big deal, but it is to me and I am happy this APC unit works that way. Cons: - There are only five battery outlets and two surge-only outlets.  I think this is probably enough for 675 VA.  The spacing is good for a combination of wall warts and straight plugs (see pictures).\n\n- There is no display of voltage or current draw as seen in higher tier APC products and maybe even a few competitors at this price point.  I really like that information displayed at a glance.  You can see Wattage (divide by Voltage to get Amperage) through PowerChute, but itâs not as easy.  Not that big a deal.  I have bigger UPSs with the display and I can count on one hand how many times I looked at them.  Their brightness has probably irritated me more than the utility of it.  Yet on the other hand again, I have on numerous occasions moved a UPS with a display around to test the current draw of something or other.  A display on this unit would be especially useful due to its small form factor and ease of moving around.  I am being wishy washy, I know.  Itâs a trade-off.  And yes a clamp-on ammeter is on wish list.\n\n- The battery compartment.  Its on the bottom.  The door is pretty solid.  I donât think it will break like others I have.  Here is my beef, and I have yet to see a UPS from any manufacturer that fail here:  The cable management in the battery compartment is ridiculous, and I am not talking about aesthetics.  The batteryâs leads donât run and connect in a sensible way.  It is always a puzzle to get them hooked onto the battery, battery pushed in so that no leads slip free during battery insertion, no wires are pinched or stretched and the bay door closes.  APC has smartly disconnected the positive lead for shipping, so with this unit I got to experience my pet peeve first thing. Overall Review: - RBC battery 4.15âx 5.95â x 2.55â $40 on APC vs $20 elsewhere.  12v ~7ah.  I have never seen this battery before.  A quick search found it is not too rare, however, the model number on the battery is only RPC.  When carefully measuring it and examining the specs on APC website I got one set of dimensions.  I found âRPCâ elsewhere with dimensions different enough so that I know those replacements wouldnât fit.  Be careful, I guess, but UPS batteries WILL fail within a couple of years and when they do, it takes a small feat of engineering to get a replacement from another source.  Am I a miser?  Should I just go to APCs website and pay double?  I probably spend $100/year on replacement batteries.  It adds up, but I am never really sure they work as well.  \n\n- I have used UPS units for thirty years.  My expectations have changed since the first one I bought.  I live in Central Florida on the East coast.  It may be due to the excessive amounts of lightning we get, but especially in the summer we lose power once a week or so.  It usually lasts less than 60 seconds, but sometimes maybe a couple or three minutes.  Computers, DVRs, routers, gigabit switches and the fiber modem all hum along without incident.  No waiting for crashed computers to boot up (if they ever do), no troubleshooting router issues or Heaven forbid part of the show a DVR was recording didnât record.  This is where a UPS shines.\n\n- When Irma was blowing through and the power went out, I shut everything down and we used them to charge the cell phones and cell phone external batteries.  You could keep your cell phones charged for a few days with this unit.\n\n- The point is, they are not magic power.  They work great for really short outages.  Anything more than about ten minutes and you should be thinking about something more industrial with car batteries and a generator.","name":"BE670M1 â I like it","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":"5","ratingValue":"5","worstRating":"1"}}],"width":"7.5 in","height":"6.6 in","weight":"8.55 oz","itemCondition":"NewCondition"}</script><div id="product-warranty" class="swiper-box-top"><h2 class="swiper-box-top-title">Warranty &amp;

battery for 24 hours before use. I can't emphasize this enough. Good battery management calls for it. \n\nWithout doubt the life of an SLA battery is maximized by not discharging it for long periods when it didn't start out fully charged. Battery should be inexpensive to replace in a few years. \n\nTypically USP batteries start declines after about two years, unless your electrical grid looks like something out of New Delhi in which case the life will be shorter if you have to hit it often. The self test will watch battery performance an ping you when the battery is due for a replacement.\n\nMost of my APC gear has held up over the years, I wore out a couple of them, but considering that a $300 bit can protect thousands worth of gear, I just replace my mission critical ones every few years. The batteries on the larger units are expensive.\n\nA five egg rating as the entire experience as was exactly what was expected from a consumers standpoint.\n\nMy expectations as a seasoned tech was also met without any broken eggs.","Pros":"Operated exactly as advertised. This review unit arrived with excellent timing. The day after I installed it the power here went out for over an hour with several outages the following week!\n\nNot only did the BU 600 keep my cable modem, gigabit switch and a high end router running without missing a beat, I was even able to keep my phone charging. Estimated run time with the new battery and minimalist load was 3 hours+. Of course age reduces the battery capacity, but if you use this product in your server room, it will keep your web connections and routers running like nothing happened for at least 60+ minutes\n\nManagement software is a free download. The unit was detected on my win7\u002F64 laptop USB and windows drivers installed, and then I installed the APC software. No eyebrow raisers there.\n\nWall mounting holes a nice touch. USB charge port @ 1.5amps shows engineers are listening to customers. I'm seeing this all over the business lately. I just bought a nice desk lamp that has a USB charge port on it.","Cons":"PowerChute software has been around long enough that I would expect all little issues to be resolved. My software reported that I was drawing just 3-6 watts of power while running on battery.  My phone drawing 5volts at 1 amp is 5 watts on its own.\n\nThat seemed pretty low, but bottom line with a small load of mission critical network gear you should expect the Back UPS 600 to keep you connected fsor most short outages. Out average outage here is under 30 minutes. The unit was tested a few times during the second week it was here, as the power went out several times a day.\n\nNo software on CD must be downloaded from APC ( not a con for me, I have multiple APC units on site so the software was sitting on a NAS)\n\nWhile my unit was perfect, you'll notice several duds and complaints. Don't expect high quality control standards on a product selling sub $100 these days. Failure numbers as high as 5% might be acceptable.","BoughtTimeType":0,"TechLevelType":0,"TotalVoting":15,"TotalConsented":15,"IsNewReview":true,"IsVoted":false,"VoteValue":null,"VendorReplayInfo":null,"PurchaseMark":"2","VideoUploadID":null,"VideoInfo":null,"MostHelpfulMark":false,"ImageStatus":"N","ReviewImageList":null,"TurntoSourceName":null,"HaveProfileLink":true},{"JobTitle":"","MerchantType":"","MerchantIndustry":"","Merchantsize":"","B2bExclusiveReview":"false","CompanyName":"","BrandId":1317,"TotalReviews":404,"SubCategoryId":72,"HasPurchased":false,"WebItemNumber":"N82E16842301669","Item":"42-301-669","BrandDescription":"APC","SubCategoryDescription":"UPS","ItemDescription":"APC BE600M1 Back-UPS 600 VA 330 Watts 7 Outlets Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) with USB Charging Port (Replaces BE550G)","ShowOEMMARK":false,"ShowOEMRetail":true,"HasVendorReplay":false,"ProductImageInfo":{"ItemNumber":"N82E16842301669","ImageTitle":"APC BE600M1 Back-UPS 600 VA 330 Watts 7 Outlets Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) with USB Charging Port (Replaces BE550G)","HasWaterMark":false,"IsComboBundleImage":false,"ImageType":0,"IsDFISImage":false,"ImageInternalCount":0,"Scene7ImageInfo":{"ImageName":"","SpecialImageList":null,"ImageSetImageList":null,"ImageSetName":null,"SpinSetImageList":null,"SpinSetName":null,"ThumbnailSetImageList":null,"ThumbnailSetName":null,"VendorSetImageList":null},"NormalImageInfo":{"ImageName":"42-301-669-09.jpg","ImageNameList":"42-301-669-09.jpg,42-301-669-10.jpg,42-301-669-11.jpg,42-301-669-12.jpg,42-301-669-13.jpg,42-301-669-14.jpg,42-301-669-15.jpg","DFIS360ImgFlag":"42-301-669_RY"},"ItemType":{"IsDigitalRiverItem":false,"IsDVDItem":false,"IsOpenBoxItem":false,"IsRecertifiedItem":false,"IsAITItem":false,"IsPhoneItem":false,"IsServicePlanItem":false,"IsSimCardItem":false,"IsRestrictedItem":false,"IsComboBundle":false,"IsSimplxityItem":false,"IsProductKeyOnlyItem":false,"IsMicrosoftDownloadItem":false,"IsCellPhoneWithPlanItem":false,"IsStandaloneSNETItem":false,"IsSNETItem":false,"IsCiscoServiceItem":false,"IsClearanceItem":false,"IsBOMDIYItem":false,"IsBOMPOSItem":false,"IsBOMBTOItem":false,"IsAvailableForRegion":true,"IsSubscription":false,"IsRegularSubscription":false,"IsCancelSubscription":false,"IsCommitmentSubscription":false,"IsSubscriptionOnly":false}},"LanguageCode":"en-us","IsBuyer":false,"IsWrote":false,"ApproveStates":"Y","BadgeList":null,"DisclaimerList":null,"ItemNumber":4750932,"Rating":4,"InDate":"2016-09-25T18:14:56.573","Title":"Great for many uses. 2 Year warranty.","NickName":"Milton B.","DisplayName":"Milton B.","EncryCustomerNumber":"k4HcW7pXkBuhC3hu5dA0wA==","Comments":"When shopping for Uninterruptible Power Supply, itâs not always necessary to over buy, in terms of available backup power. 600VA wonât handle a hi-end Gaming PC, but it will do great UPS protection and power for most average home PCâs, Laptops, Routers, Switches, Backup Drivesâ¦ even a lamp.\n\nI first followed the directions and plugged in the battery. I like that itâs shipped, fresh battery on the ready and unused. Just open the door on the bottom, plug in the battery terminals and youâre ready. I let mine charge overnight and started with my Laptop and Router. When I pulled the AC plug and saw how far I could still stay connected, the Power Chute Software showed way more than needed time to stay connected. Over a half hour of run time was how long I had. Schedule how soon the Power Chute Software should safely turn off your PC. \n\nI guess I was the lucky one. No beeps, no miss signaling annoying me. This is doing its job, and within its specs is a good value for the price. You could easily spend twice as much and not need the extra battery life. I have other APC Battery Backupâs being used and is my go to brand. MY setup has several, several electrical devices from my printer to my LAN switch, to my router and so on. The APC can also support these along with your PC, Laptop, etc.\n\nI didnât write a review an hour after getting it, I have tried it out over weeks.

It does not have a LCD screen with live updates, but it is not priced for that either. It does not have 10 backup ports, but itâs not priced for that either. It has an average output for a desktop setup, has monitoring options via a USB cable, and a small form factor for space saving on\u002Funder a desk.

I would likely choose a higher capacity backup for more demanding systems. My current configuration has about 6 minutes run time under load, which is a thin margin, for a 5 minute auto shutdown on battery power. However; in the event of power loss, I should have plenty of warning.\n\nAlthough I configured this backup for use with my PC, there are many different scenarios that you could use this backup.  \n\nUsing this as a dedicated battery backup for a modem and router, could provide internet access during an outage (if there is no damage to the lines or external events that would prevent access). Even attaching Wi-Fi enabled power outlet(s) aside from the modem and router could provide power to emergency lighting controllable from your smart phone or tablet.\nYou could even attach a USB powered light to the charging port for emergency battery backup lighting.\n\nI wish this back up was considered portable, but lead-acid batteries can be a bit dangerous, so I wouldnât pack one in your hiking backpack. Charging it up and carrying it to the back deck to power a radio should be fine (just make sure its not going to rain).\n\nOverall this has been a fantastic backup through out my testing. The PowerChute software was more informative and useful than I expected, and the USB charging port was also a welcome addition. \nThe pros far outweigh the cons, and would be an easy recommendation to anyone looking for a decent battery backup with this capacity. 5 eggs.","Pros":"+\nâ¢ 5 Battery backup outlets\nâ¢ All outlets protected with surge suppression.\nâ¢ USB charging port (1.5A)\nâ¢ PC power monitoring software (PowerChute)\nâ¢ LED power mode indicator (AC, battery backup)\nâ¢ Muted aesthetics, not an eye catcher.\nâ¢ 45Âº angled power plug is great for crowded outlets or power strips.\nâ¢ Seamless backup power in the event of power loss. \n\nI set this battery backup for use with my PC and monitor, and has been a great addition to my set up. The PowerChute software provides almost real-time power consumption and estimated battery run time on power failure. The PowerChute software can be configured to shut down your PC for you in the event of power loss, at a set interval of time. \nFor my hardware scenario I set the software to 5 minutes on battery before shutting down my PC, given my current PC hardware configuration. \nCurrent specs:\ni7 5820k\nx99 motherboard\nGTX 1060 6GB OC\n16GB DDR4 1.35v (2x 8GB)\n2 SSDâs, and one 3TB WD black HD.\n1x BD\u002FDVD optical.\n4 140mm fans, 2 120mm fans\n630W 80+ gold rated PSU\n\nThis battery backup is sufficient for my use, as even under load (gaming) the software reports that I should have more than 6 minutes of battery run time. At idle the PowerChute software reports that I should have 18+ minutes on battery, which is plenty of time to save work and shut down should I choose to extend the battery run time before auto shutdown.\n\nSome other nice features of the PowerChute software is that it can report daily cost of operating attached equipment, total energy usage per month in kWh and interestingly estimated carbon dioxide emissions per day. Perform firmware updates, run self diagnostics, set hours at which alarms are active (if you dont want to be alerted to an alarm at 3 a.m.)\nWhat Iâve checked most often is the current energy consumption and load on battery backup. I was surprised to see that my system uses much less energy than I thought, with an average of 115 Watts at idle, and 265 +\u002F- Watts under load, this is including my 144Hz monitor drawing 23 Watts.\n\nI really like the addition of a USB charging port, which also provides power on battery. \nThis is a great way to charge your phone in a power outage, a 1.5 amp capacity should be enough for most phones and most tablets.","Cons":"-\nThe UPS I received had a strong chemical odor, which dissipated after about a week.\n(I may have been unlucky with the unit I received, but if you are sensitive to chemical smells, you might consider unpacking and leaving this unit in a room that you don't frequent, for a few days)\n\nThe PowerChute software is available as a download from APC, the easiest way to find it is to follow the address from the included instructions.

I monitored the unit after I ran the battery to what it reported as 0% and it took almost 10 hours to recharge to 100% again, kind of slow but not troublesome.

It appears to built well, the battery is easily accessible for replacement. The power button is recessed a bit which is a nice touch so you don't accidentally turn it off and the green power light is not too bright or annoying. The unit includes a USB charging port that could be used to charge a phone or other USB device during a power outage. The unit can be cold started (turned out without being plugged in), which is something I always like to see a UPS able to do. The Powerchute software that works with the unit is fairly simple and easy to configure, as well as it lets you monitor the status of the UPS. This UPS can provide enough power for a regular desktop to have time to save work and shut down properly, or keep a cable modem and wireless router on for a few hours.","Cons":"The unit could use a small display with some status information like those found on the large units. Also an extra USB port would be nice as well.  The battery charge time is a bit long if you happen to suffer multiple outages in a day. The Powerchute software could also use a little less of the extra fluff.

I have never seen this battery before.  A quick search found it is not too rare, however, the model number on the battery is only RPC.  When carefully measuring it and examining the specs on APC website I got one set of dimensions.  I found âRPCâ elsewhere with dimensions different enough so that I know those replacements wouldnât fit.  Be careful, I guess, but UPS batteries WILL fail within a couple of years and when they do, it takes a small feat of engineering to get a replacement from another source.  Am I a miser?  Should I just go to APCs website and pay double?  I probably spend $100\u002Fyear on replacement batteries.  It adds up, but I am never really sure they work as well.  \n\n- I have used UPS units for thirty years.  My expectations have changed since the first one I bought.  I live in Central Florida on the East coast.  It may be due to the excessive amounts of lightning we get, but especially in the summer we lose power once a week or so.  It usually lasts less than 60 seconds, but sometimes maybe a couple or three minutes.  Computers, DVRs, routers, gigabit switches and the fiber modem all hum along without incident.  No waiting for crashed computers to boot up (if they ever do), no troubleshooting router issues or Heaven forbid part of the show a DVR was recording didnât record.  This is where a UPS shines.\n\n- When Irma was blowing through and the power went out, I shut everything down and we used them to charge the cell phones and cell phone external batteries.  You could keep your cell phones charged for a few days with this unit.\n\n- The point is, they are not magic power.  They work great for really short outages.  Anything more than about ten minutes and you should be thinking about something more industrial with car batteries and a generator.","Pros":"- It really is small for the VA rating.  I have two other 600VA UPS units and they are 2x-3x the size volume wise.  It is also fairly thin.  It would have been great to fit into a phone interface cabinet I worked on several years ago.  It had a PBX, cable modem and WiFi router in it.  We had to build a shelf on the wall outside of it for the UPS.  Ugly and a little precarious.  This would have fit.  Perhaps another good application would be an external DVR enclosure for a camera system.  Hopefully you get the idea.\n\n- The keyholes for mounting on the back side look like they could be useful.  I donât have use for them at the moment, but \nThe price of the APC 650 VA (with the older style case) is about $11 more expensive than this 675 VA unit.  That makes this unit a better value in terms of $\u002FVA.  A quick search and you will find it competitive with other manufacturers as well.\n\n- The PowerChute software works for what it is intended, and the interface is the cleanest I have seen so far.  The functionality of PowerChute is a bit more limited than I have seen in other products, but does what you need it to do.  That is, give you an idea of how heavily you are loaded, how much time you could go without power and shut down your computer gracefully at a configurable low battery threshold (which I would recommend raising from default).  I raised mine way up to test shutdown and it worked as advertised.  I will tell you this: If your threshold is set low, in a year or more when your battery is aging, it will fail before the threshold or shortly after and not give your computer enough time to shut down.  I have seen this more times than I have seen this feature work!  I would say 30%-50% is a good threshhold.\n\n- USB charging port?  Iâm using it right now to charge my vape while I write this review.  Not really sure when your UPS is sitting next to you and other USB ports are not, but OK.  It does work.\n\n- When I tested by pulling the plug from the wall, the unit eventually ran out of battery.  When I plugged it back in, the unit did not require manual intervention to restore power to its ports.  Some of my UPSs require me to press and hold the power button for a couple seconds to restore normal operation.  Meanwhile everything is dead.  This may not sound like a big deal, but it is to me and I am happy this APC unit works that way.","Cons":"- There are only five battery outlets and two surge-only outlets.  I think this is probably enough for 675 VA.  The spacing is good for a combination of wall warts and straight plugs (see pictures).\n\n- There is no display of voltage or current draw as seen in higher tier APC products and maybe even a few competitors at this price point.  I really like that information displayed at a glance.  You can see Wattage (divide by Voltage to get Amperage) through PowerChute, but itâs not as easy.  Not that big a deal.  I have bigger UPSs with the display and I can count on one hand how many times I looked at them.  Their brightness has probably irritated me more than the utility of it.  Yet on the other hand again, I have on numerous occasions moved a UPS with a display around to test the current draw of something or other.  A display on this unit would be especially useful due to its small form factor and ease of moving around.  I am being wishy washy, I know.  Itâs a trade-off.  And yes a clamp-on ammeter is on wish list.\n\n- The battery compartment.  Its on the bottom.  The door is pretty solid.  I donât think it will break like others I have.  Here is my beef, and I have yet to see a UPS from any manufacturer that fail here:  The cable management in the battery compartment is ridiculous, and I am not talking about aesthetics.  The batteryâs leads donât run and connect in a sensible way.  It is always a puzzle to get them hooked onto the battery, battery pushed in so that no leads slip free during battery insertion, no wires are pinched or stretched and the bay door closes.
